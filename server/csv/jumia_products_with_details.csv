Product details
The Itel S24 brings decent features at an affordable price point. Its 90Hz HD+ IPS display provides smooth visuals, although it could be brighter outdoors with its 480 nits peak brightness.

The 8MP selfie camera does its job adequately for casual snaps.
 Security-wise, the inclusion of both fingerprint and face unlock adds convenience and ensures personal data stays protected. With 4G network connectivity, browsing and streaming are smooth, though users shouldn't expect blazing-fast speeds.
